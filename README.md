# Go Proxy Server

A configurable proxy server in Go, supporting rotating IPv4/IPv6 addresses, session and external authentication.
## Features

- IPv4 or IPv6 back-connect
- Multiple IPv6-IPv4 prefixes supported, with per-country prefixes
- Session and timeout support to re-use generated IP
- Up to 14,000 requests per second
- DNS resolution and caching
- Automatic IPv6 routing and sysctl setup
- One core = one listener via reuseport

## Limitations

- No SOCKS5 support
  - SOCKS5 resolves IP locally which makes it inefficient for hosts without IPv6

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Server with IPv6 support and large-enough subnet ([Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=BV2rohR8OBWQ) offers /64 subnets, *sponsored link*).

### Configuration

Copy the `config.example.yaml` file to `config.yaml` and modify the settings as needed.

Example:
```yaml
listen_address: "::"
listen_port: 8080
debug_mode: false # Enable pretty-print logs, don't enable in production
test_port: -1 # Enable a test server on port 8081 for benchmarking
network_type: "tcp6" # tcp = dual-stack, tcp6 = IPv6 only, tcp4 = IPv4 only
max_timeout: 30 # Maximum timeout for a request in seconds
http_close: true # Force "Connection: close" header in HTTP-only requests (faster)
auth:
  type: "credentials" # none, credentials, redis
  credentials:
    username: "username"
    password: "password"
  redis:
    dsn: "redis://localhost:6379" # Will compare the username as key to the password
bind_prefixes:
  - "2a14:dead:beef::1/48" # List of prefixes to bind to
  - "2a14:dead:feed::1/48"
located_prefixes:
  ch:
    - "2a14:dead:beef::/48"
  uk:
    - "2a14:dead:feed::/48"
deleted_headers: # List of headers to delete (HTTP only), this make proxy anonymous
  - "Proxy-Authorization"
  - "Proxy-Connection"
```

### Build

```bash
go build .
./go-proxy
```

### Usage example

```bash
# Without credentials, if enabled
curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://api.ipquery.io

# Session
curl -x http://john-session-abcdef1234:doe@localhost:8080 http://api.ipquery.io

# Session with timeout
curl -x http://john-session-abcdef1234-timeout-10:doe@localhost:8080 http://api.ipquery.io
```

> Session ID must be alphanumeric, between 6 and 24 characters.
> The timeout is in minutes, between 1 and 30 minutes.

## Benchmark

Benchmark can be run with `go test -bench=.`. Configuration should have `test_port` set to 8081 and credentials
set to `username:password`.
